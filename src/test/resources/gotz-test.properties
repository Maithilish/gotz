# there are two user provided property files in test
# 1. gotz-provided-test.properties - used by tests in ConfigServiceTest to test
#    user provided properties
# 2. gotz-test.properties - used by all other tests to override defaults properties
#    like gotz.beanFile etc. so that all conditions are tested properly

# while writing test use this file to toggle properties and don't touch the
# gotz-provided-test.properties

gotz.beanFile=/testdefs/simple/bean.xml
